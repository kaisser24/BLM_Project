The purpose of this repository is to provide a shot counter for public use shooting ranges. The primary location this project will be tested at McCabe's shooting Range, located in Hartman's rock Recreation Area. This device will provide comprehensive data to the time of day the firing ranges see the most amount of traffic without causing a big brother incident with the shooters and the Bureau of Land Management. These devices will be small enough to hidden from the public preventing anyone from wanting to cause damage to the device. All information will be stored on a web application where the user will be able to sort, filter, and manage the device all from a one-stop shop.
